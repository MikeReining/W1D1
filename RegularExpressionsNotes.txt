Match Groups

(.*)\.pdf$ - Match file names with any character excluding the .pdf extension

Nested Groups

This expression requires capturing two parts of the data, both the year and the whole date. This requires using nested capture groups, as in the expression 
(\w+ (\d+)) 

We can alternatively use \s+ in lieu of the space, to catch any number of whitespace between the month and the year.

Lesson 13

we just need to capture the two groups of digits as such 
(\d+)x(\d+)

Lesson 14
